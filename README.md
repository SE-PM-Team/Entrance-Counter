# Basic structure
Main branch is for the different versions. Only when a new version is finished, will main be updated.\
Development branch is for developing each version. This means that after you are finished with your ticket(a task), you will push to this branch.\
For each ticket you create a new branch with the same ID as the issue. E.g. issue: Adding a new device #18; new branch: ticket-#18.\
Issues are small or large assignments and can be found in the "projects" tab (see navbar). \
